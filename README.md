# CoatHanger

This is a README for a project in progress.

The project name is CoatHanger.

This project seeks to create an app that will provide clothing recommendation
based on the predicted weather of the day.

In the morning, a notification will arrive to the users phone with a weather report
and the clothing recommendation that is suitable for whatever weather was suggested.

The original weather API provider was to be the Weather Underground API, but the
free service from that API was discontinued earlier this year.

Now the direction has changed to using the Yahoo! Weather API. 

The recommendation will draw on factors like the temperature, humidity, likelihood of rain,
cloudiness, and windiness. Perhaps even non-weather factors such as elevation could be
incorporated to give the best possible recommendation for the user.

I hope that this app will help people not make a fuss in the morning thinking about how
they will have to prepare for the weather for the day ahead. Instead, the appropriate 
clothing selection will be provided to them, and all they would have to do would be wearing
the clothing selection without wasting valuable time in the morning.

Possible monetization options could include ads for the clothing items in the clothing selection.
For example, if there is an item in the clothing suggestion that you don't have, perhaps there could 
be a link that takes you do a website where you could purchase the item.
