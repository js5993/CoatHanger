# CoatHanger

This is a README for a project in progress.

The project name is CoatHanger.

This project seeks to create an app that will provide clothing recommendation
based on the predicted weather of the day.

In the morning, a notification will arrive to the users phone with a weather report
and the clothing recommendation that is suitable for whatever weather was suggested.

It is expected that this app will use the Yahoo! Weather API.

The recommendation will rely on factors such as the temperature, humidity, raininess, cloudiness, and windiness.
In time, factors such as elevation could be incorporated for even better recommendation.

This app will help its users save valuable time in the morning by saving them the trouble of having to figure out the appropriate clothing for the weather.

Possible monetization options could include ads for the clothing items in the clothing selection.
For example, if there is an item in the clothing suggestion that you don't have, perhaps there could 
be a link that takes you do a website where you could purchase the item.
